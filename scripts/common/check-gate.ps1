# check-gate.ps1 - run every local gate this host can run, in one command.
#
# ⭐ THE TWIN OF check-gate.sh, and the one to prefer on Windows. It earns a
# twin by the rule in check-twins.sh: a native PowerShell session may have no
# POSIX shell at all, and "run the whole gate" is exactly the command somebody
# reaches for on a machine where that is true. Everything else under common/
# runs after the probe has reported and can assume sh; this cannot, because it
# is what a session runs first.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that was skipped because it was the
# ninth thing to remember. Part (a) of docs/methodology/gate.md is a LIST, and a
# list run by hand is run in the order somebody recalls it, missing whichever
# entry was added last.
#
# ⛔ IT IS NOT A SECOND SET OF RULES. Every line below shells out to a check
# that already exists and reads that check's own exit code. When this file and
# .github/workflows/ci.yml disagree about what runs, CI is the one that gates a
# push and this one is the defect.
#
# ── ⚠ A SKIPPED CHECK IS NOT A PASSED CHECK ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Some of these need a tool that is not everywhere: sh, jq, shellcheck,
# PSScriptAnalyzer. A gate that silently dropped one and still printed green
# would be the "step that exits 0 having done nothing it was asked to do" row in
# docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md. So a missing tool is SKIP, counted
# separately, named in the summary and carried in -Json as `skipped`.
#
# ── ⚠ -Fast, AND WHY IT IS A FLAG RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT ───────────────────
#
# Measured on one Windows 11 machine, 2026-08-27: the full run took 208s and
# check-twins was 171s of it, because that check runs both halves of every pair
# and there are ten pairs. That is the right price before a push and the wrong
# one before each of eleven commits, and a gate too slow to run is a gate that
# gets run once at the end.
#
# ⛔ -Fast SKIPS check-twins. It does not weaken anything else, it is reported
# as a SKIP like every other, and the summary says so. The full run is what a
# push is gated on.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Fast
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Json

#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/git-sync.ps1 -Message "..." -BodyFile msg.txt `
#        -Gate "pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1"
#
# Exit codes: 0 everything that ran passed, 1 something failed, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
