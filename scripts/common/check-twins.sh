# check-twins.sh - do the two probe implementations still answer the same way?
#
# The defect this exists to catch is DRIFT between two scripts that are supposed
# to do the same job. One gets a fix, a field, a flag; the other does not; and
# six months later one is polished and the other is a barebones copy that nobody
# noticed had fallen behind. The failure is silent, because each one works fine
# on its own host and nobody runs both.
#
# ── ⭐ WHY ONLY THE PROBE HAS A TWIN, AND WHY THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT ───────
#
# Every other check here is POSIX sh alone, deliberately. Two implementations
# of one rule is two places for that rule to be wrong, so a twin has to earn
# itself. The probe earns it and nothing else does:
#
#   scripts/doctor/  RUNS BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT IS INSTALLED. That is its whole
#                    job. It cannot require a POSIX layer, because "is there a
#                    POSIX layer" is one of the questions it answers. So it
#                    needs a native implementation per host family.
#
#   scripts/common/  check-gate EARNS ONE TOO, and for the same reason as the
#   check-gate       probe rather than a different one. It is the command a
#                    session runs FIRST, before anything has established that a
#                    POSIX shell is reachable, and on a native PowerShell
#                    session with no Git Bash on PATH an sh-only runner is a
#                    runner that cannot start. Its two halves delegate to the
#                    same underlying checks, so the drift surface is the LIST
#                    and not the rules, and the row below is what holds the list
#                    in step.
#
#   everything else  runs AFTER the probe has reported. By then sh is known to
#                    be present or known to be absent, and on Windows that means
#                    Git Bash, WSL or msys, all of which the probe reports. A
#                    second implementation would add a drift surface and buy
#                    nothing.
#
# ⛔ So the rule is: a twin exists only where a single implementation cannot
# run, and wherever a twin exists, THIS CHECK covers it. Adding a twin without
# adding it here is how drift starts.
#
# ── WHAT DIFFERENCE IS CORRECT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ⚠ Some disagreement is honest and must not be flattened away. Each twin
# reports what ITS OWN host can reach, and on a Windows machine with msys
# installed those genuinely differ: `bash` and `tar` resolve to different
# binaries, `zsh` is on the msys PATH and not the native one, and
# PSScriptAnalyzer is a PowerShell module invisible to sh.
#
# ⭐ So this compares the SHAPE and the FACTS, not the tool-by-tool verdicts:
# the schema, the keys, the host and repo values that describe one machine.
# A machine cannot have two architectures.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-twins.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-twins.sh --json
#   sh scripts/common/check-twins.sh --verbose      also list per-tool differences
#
# Exit codes: 0 they agree, 1 they have drifted, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

set -u

# ⛔ Every child of this script gets the recursion guard. check-gate is one of
# the pairs compared below and check-gate runs THIS script, so without it the

# at each spawn site, because a guard applied at one of several call sites is
# the most recurring hole there is.

# --- 7. every OTHER twin pair, compared on this tree --------------------------
# ⛔ THE PROBE IS NO LONGER THE ONLY TWIN, so it is no longer the only thing
# compared. Every check in common/ has a PowerShell implementation, because the
# sh ones cannot run on a Windows host that has no POSIX layer: measured on one
# Windows 11 machine, native PowerShell had no `sed` at all and `sort` resolved
# to PowerShell's own Sort-Object alias rather than the coreutils binary. ⚠ The
# second is the dangerous one: a missing tool fails loudly, an aliased one
# silently returns a different answer.
#
# ⭐ THE COMPARISON IS THE --json OUTPUT AND THE EXIT CODE, both read from the
# process that produced them. Two implementations of one rule agreeing on a
# clean tree proves very little; they are mutation-proven together, which is
# what scripts/README.md asks for.
# ⚠ IT COMPARES ANSWERS ON THIS TREE, NOT THE RULES THEMSELVES. A scope
# difference with nothing in the tree to exercise it is INVISIBLE here:
# dropping `.py` from one twin's extension list changed no number, because this
# repository has no `.py` file. Dropping `.md` was caught instantly. ⭐ So a
# scope rule is proven by adding a fixture that exercises it, not by trusting
# this comparison to notice.
