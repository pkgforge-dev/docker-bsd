# check-gate.sh - run every local gate this host can run, in one command.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that was skipped because it was the
# ninth thing to remember. Part (a) of docs/methodology/gate.md is a LIST, and a
# list run by hand is a list run in the order somebody remembers it, missing
# whichever entry was added last. The session that wrote this ran that list once
# per work item and re-typed it every time, which is exactly how one of them
# quietly stops being run.
#
# ⛔ IT IS NOT A SECOND SET OF RULES. Every line below shells out to a check
# that already exists and reads that check's own exit code. When this file and
# .github/workflows/ci.yml disagree about what runs, CI is the one that gates a
# push and this one is the defect.
#
# ── ⚠ A SKIPPED CHECK IS NOT A PASSED CHECK ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Some of these need a tool that is not everywhere: shellcheck, jq, pwsh,
# PSScriptAnalyzer. A gate that silently dropped one of them and still printed
# green would be the "step that exits 0 having done nothing it was asked to do"
# row in docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md.
#
# So a missing tool is reported as SKIP, counted separately, named in the
# summary line and carried in --json as `skipped`. ⭐ The exit code is still 0,
# because "this host cannot run that one" is not a failure of the tree; the
# caller reads `skipped` to decide whether it wants that answer. CI runs on two
# hosts that between them have every tool, which is where the coverage comes
# from.
#
# ── ⚠ --fast, AND WHY IT IS A FLAG RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT ──────────────────
#
# Measured on one Windows 11 machine, 2026-08-27: the full run took 208s and
# check-twins was 171s of it, because that check runs both halves of every pair
# and there are ten pairs. That is the right price before a push and the wrong
# one before each of eleven commits, and a gate too slow to run is a gate that
# gets run once at the end.
#
# ⛔ --fast SKIPS check-twins. It does not weaken anything else, it is reported
# as a SKIP like every other, and the summary says so. The full run is what a
# push is gated on.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --fast
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 everything that ran passed, 1 something failed, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
